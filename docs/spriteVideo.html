<H1>How to make an animation from a video</h1>
A low resolution spritesheet can be made from a youtube video by using the cntl-alt-prt sc combination.<br>
This keyboard combination will copy the current screen.  You can pause a youtube video multiple times and take screen shots<br>
Create a sprite sheet by opening mspaint and copying each screen into the sheet<br>
Here is an example I made from a youtube video on the amongus download task<br>
<a href="images/amongUsDownload.jpg"><img src="images/amongUsDownload.jpg" width="200px"></a> (click on it to make bigger)<br>

This code will "animate" the sprite sheet<br>
