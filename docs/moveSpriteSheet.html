<H1>Animating character movement with a sprite sheet</h1>
Sprite sheets are a great way to show character movement<br>
Usually they contain a variety of still pictures that you can rotate between when your player is moving<br>
Also, the sheet usually has pictures organized to simulate left to right, right to left, up to down and down to up movement<br>
These groups correspond to the wasd keys that people are familiar with<br>
This code shows an example that handles the w key (down to up) movement.<br>
