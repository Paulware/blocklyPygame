<H1>How to determine if a tic-tac-toe game is over</h1>
Assuming that the moves are numbered left-to-right, up to down, 0..8<br>

Currently only the first winning combination is represented by 0,1,2,<br>
There are other winning combinations as well: 
<ul>
  <li>3,4,5</li>
  <li>6,7,8</li>
  <li>0,3,6</li>
  <li>1,4,7</li>
  <li>2,5,8</li>
  <li>0,4,8</li>
  <li>2,4,6</li>
</ul>
