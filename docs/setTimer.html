<H1>How to use a timer</h1>
Timers are useful when you need to slow down a particular behavior<br>
There are 9 timers that are standard with this project<br>
This code will set the first timer and then check if it has elapsed<br>
Remember to set the timer again, after it has elapsed, otherwise it will stay elapsed<br>

<b>Note:</b>The alternate way to slow down a task, is to place a wait block in the code<br>
But this will slow down everything.   A timer is a better use of the processing power of your computer<br>
